# Code Sample 

`columnChart.js` is an example of bespoke chart created for a story as a class. This allowed me to reuse the chart in different ways throughout a story, and would make it easy to modify if a future story justified a similar treatment.

`index.js` is an example of using that class to init a new a chart, and update it in a carousel form. Though it's easily adapted to scrolling or event triggers as well.
